    "- van Rossum promoted Python through his \\\"Computer Programming for Everybody\\\" initiative that had the *goal to encourage a basic level of coding literacy* as an equal knowledge alongside English literacy and math skills\",\n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** (which combine Python with *Markdown*) are essentially \"digital lab notebooks.\" They are the best choice for exploratory data analysis, as they allow you to keep your code, results, and plots in the same place as your written interpretations and notes. Because you can run code \"cell-by-cell,\" you don't have to re-run an hour-long data processing step just to change the color of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you should switch to **regular Python programming** (.py files) in VS Code (or other editor) when your project moves from \"experimenting\" to automation or production. If you are writing a complex tool that needs to be run hundreds of times on a server, or if you are writing a function that you plan to share with others, a regular script is much faster, easier to debug, and more reliable than a notebook."

    "### Markdown, Code, and Raw Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook consists of cells of different types. The two cell types that are most popular are *\"Markdown\"* and *\"Code\"* cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default **Code cells** contain actual Python code. To edit an existing code cell, click on it with a mouse. \n",
    "You are \"in\" a code cell if its frame is highlighted in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **execute**, or \"run,\" a code cell, hold down the **Ctrl** key and press **Enter**. \n",
    "Note that you do *not* go to the next cell. \n",
    "Alternatively, you can hold the **Shift** key and press **Enter**, which executes your current cell *and* goes to the next cell or creates a new one if there is none.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Markdown cell** is also in either edit or command mode. For example, if you double-click on the current cell, you will be placed into *edit mode*. \n",
    "\n",
    "To change a cell's type, choose either \"Code\" or \"Markdown\" in the navigation bar at the top. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 Markdown Reference\n",
    "For a quick guide on formatting your notes, check out the [**Markdown Cheat Sheet**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "You can also use the GitHub's [**Getting Started with Markdown**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "**A \"Raw\" cell** (specifically \"Raw NBConvert\") is a cell type where the content is not \"interpreted\" by the notebook. Raw cells are treated as plain text exactly as you typed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use a Raw cell?  \n",
    "- *Preventing Execution*: If you have a block of code or a sequence that you want to keep as a reference but do not want Python to run, placing it in a Raw cell ensures it is ignored during \"Run All.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Storing Metadata or Logs*: You can paste raw instrument output, error logs, or configuration settings that you want to keep with the data without formatting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Advanced Document Conversion*: When using a tool called nbconvert to turn your notebook into a PDF or a LaTeX document, Raw cells can be used to pass specific commands to those formatters that shouldn't appear in the browser version.\n",

The ! is useful to execute short CLI commands without leaving a Jupyter notebook."
